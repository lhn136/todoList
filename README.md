# To Do List

I've created a simple todo list using JS HTML/CSS. 
This todo list allow you to load a .txt file to the list
(keep in mind it will delete everything on the todolist)

## Getting Started

Just run the application with any browser you have. I recommend using Chrome or Firefox. However, it'll work on any browser.

### Prerequisites

The load button only load txt file. It will not work correctly if you upload a different file type.

```
correct:   todo.txt
incorrect: 	todo.png
incorrect: 	todo.docx
```

## Development

I developed this with both DOM manipulation and jQuery. I am more famliar with DOM manipulation. I just wanted to applied some jQuery techniques to this project

## Built With

* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) - Logo and Icons
* [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com) - Used font for the text in the interface
* [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/) - Used to pull specific html tags
